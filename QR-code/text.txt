version:- This parameter is an interger from 1 to 40 that 
          controls the size of the QR code (the smallest, version 1, is a 21x21 matrix)
error_correction:- This parameter controls the error correction used for the QR Code.
        There are following four constants available for this:
        qrcode,constants.ERROR_CORRCECT_L:
            About 7% or fewer errors can be corrected.
        qrcode,constants.ERROR_CORRCECT_M(Default):
            About 15% or fewer errors can be corrected.
        qrcode,constants.ERROR_CORRCECT_Q:
            About 25% or fewer errors can be corrected.
        qrcode,constants.ERROR_CORRCECT_H:
            About 30% or fewer errors can be corrected.
box_size:- This parameter controls how many pixels each "box of the QR code is.
border:- The border parameter controls how many boxes thick the border should be (the default is 4, which is the minimum in the specification).
add_data():- This method is used to add data to the QRCode object. It takes the data to be encoded as a parameter.
make():- This method with (fit=True) ensures that the entire dimension of the QR Code is utilized, even if our input data could fit into less number of boxes.
make_image():- This method is used to convert the QRCode object into an image file. It takes the fill_color and back_color optional parameters to set the foreground and background color.
